It is a practice exercise from the course I am currently taking.
To be honest, it was a bit difficult for me — I spent about 1.5 days working on it.
Sometimes I felt sad because I thought I might be too stupid for this project.
But in the end, this work gave me an understanding of many things in JavaScript, especially with EventListener.
It was worth looking at the solution from a different perspective — and suddenly everything became so simple!
This was a very interesting task. ♥
